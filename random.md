### ✅ What apps make patterns like the one you shared?

The style in your image looks like it was made in a **cross-stitch pattern generator**, not a general drawing app. The usual suspects:

**1. WinStitch / MacStitch**  
Probably the closest match. They create grids, symbols, color legends, DMC lists, stitch counts—exactly like your example.

**2. PCStitch**  
Very popular, very similar output style. Also supports auto-converting images → DMC patterns.

**3. Stitch Fiddle** (web)  
Less fancy layouts, but still does image → pattern with DMC colors.

**4. Thread-Bare, Cross Stitch Saga, Cross Stitch Markup, Pattern Keeper**  
More for viewing, but some have pattern-generation features.

Your pattern's clean layout + symbol style + legend table strongly suggests **PCStitch or WinStitch/MacStitch**.
