### **3. Smart Study Plan**

To maximize efficiency:

1. **Focus on Literary Devices First**
    
    - Make a mini-dictionary for yourself: benzetme, teşhis, tezat, hüsnütalil, mübalağa

2. **Grammar & Punctuation**
    
    - Revisit comma, quotation, parenthesis rules
        
    - Focus on spotting the most frequent mistakes (e.g., spacing, suffixes, noun-adjective usage)
        
3. **Text Types & Themes**
    
    - Create a small table: type → key traits → example
        
    - Example: “olay hikâyesi → giriş-gelişme-çözüm, hayatın içinden kesit”
        
4. **Poetry Practice**
    
    - Translate literally **line by line** to English first
        
    - Note figurative language or unusual words
        
    - Identify devices (e.g., if a poem personifies an object → teşhis)
        
5. **Past Exams Drill**
    
    - Solve the past questions you have (or I can help check answers)
        
    - Focus on **what repeats**: punctuation, literary devices, text types

If you want, I can **go through the past exams you pasted** and make a **targeted study checklist**, showing exactly:

- Must-know literary terms
    
- Must-know grammar/punctuation rules
    
- Most common text types & their identifiers
    
- Idioms & phrases that appear often
    

This will let you **ignore filler stuff** and concentrate only on what appears in exams.

Do you want me to make that checklist next?
